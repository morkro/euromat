  "content": "As a digital tool the EUROMAT certainly has plenty of grey matter. However, it's DNA still consists of mainly Ones and Zeros. Yet, for the right composition it needs a dedicated team working on the questions, collecting the parties' comments and finally working the technical magic.  Since September 2018, a team of volunteers has been working on the development of the EUROMAT. We are members of Polis180, a Berlin-based grassroots thinktank for foreign- and European Policy, and Pulse of Europe e.V.",

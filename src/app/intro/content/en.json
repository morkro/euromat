  "content": "You‘re thinking: What‘s a EUROMAT? The EUROMAT is not a regular voting advice application. On the contrary, it is your digital tool navigating you through the policies and visions of the current European parties. The goal of the EUROMAT is to support you to make an informed choice for the upcoming European elections!\n\n**Why the European parties?** \n\nDid you know? Though we have national parties on our ballots on election day, they are part of European parties. On the European level, our national political parties bundle with other parties which share similar political ideas and visions and are active in other Member States. The European parties (for exemple PES, EPP, ALDE or the European Green Party) are represented by party groups in the European Parliament. In the end, those will determine the decision-making process in the European Parliament.\n\nWhich European party matches your opinions and future vision of the European Union most? \\\nDon‘t hesitate, find out now! \n\nAfter finishing the EUROMAT, you will be provided with an overview of the affiliations of your national parties to the European ones. \n\nLast but not least: Whatever your result, the final choice is up to YOU! \n\nThe EUROMAT focuses mainly on one thing – making your voting experience fun while providing you with all essential information about the main positions of the European parties.",

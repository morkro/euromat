      "answer": "The EUROMAT presents 33 statements on different European policy areas - such as migration or security - which you agree, disagree with or react neutrally to. Ultimately, your answers will be compared with the positions of the European parties, and the matching results presented as a percentage of correspondence. Additionally, we will give you an overview of the corresponding national parties affiliated with the respective European party. \n\nIn total, 21 parties were contacted for the compilation of statements and answers:  European People's Party (EPP), Party of European Socialists (PES), Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE), European Christian Political Movement (ECPM),  Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE),  European Democratic Party (EDP), Party of the European Left (PEL), Nordic Green Left Alliance (NGLA), European Green Party (EGP), European Free Alliance (EFA),Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom (MENF), VOLT, Alliance for Peace and Freedom (APF), Alliance for European National Movements (AENM), Initiative of Communist and Workers' Parties, DiEM25, European Federalist Party, European Pirate Party (PPEU), Euro Animal 7 (EA7), Liberal South East European Network (LIBSEEN), Europe Democracy Esperanto (EDE).\n\n 12 of those 21 parties have responded to our questionnaire. As we have not received a formal reply from 9 parties in time, we could not include them in the further EUROMAT evaluation."

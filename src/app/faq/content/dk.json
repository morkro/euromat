      "title": "What is the EUROMAT?",
      "answer": "The EUROMAT is an interactive digital tool providing you with informations about the European Parties positions towards certain political statements. \n\nThe EUROMAT presents 33 statements on different European policy areas - such as migration or security - which you agree, disagree with or react neutrally to. Ultimately, your answers will be compared with the positions of the European parties, and the matching results presented as a percentage of correspondance. It is not a voting advice, it is just an indication based on the 33 statements selected. \n\nAfter finishing the EUROMAT, you are provided with an overview of the affiliations of the political parties in your Member State to the European ones."

      "title": "How did we develop the EUROMAT?",
      "answer": "In a first step, we developed statements in several workshops. Our goals were:\n\n* to cover a maximum of relevant topics for European societies\n* to cover a broad range of diverse political opinions\n\nIn a second step, partners from other countries examined the statements for relevance in their respective countries and gave us feedback. With this feedback we finalized the statements. \n\nThen we sent a total of 49 statements to 21 parties of the European Parliament. They were asked to agree, disagree or remain neutral towards those statements. Additionally, they had the possibility to give a short explanation to their answer. \n\nThe answers of European parties were analyzed and 33 were selected to be included in the EUROMAT. The selection of the final statements was based on their capacity to help differentiate between the parties."

      "title": "Why European parties? ",
      "answer": "Though we have national parties on our ballots on election day, they are part of European parties. On the European level, our national political parties bundle with other parties which share similar political ideas and visions and are active in other Member States. The European parties (for exemple PES, EPP, ALDE or the European Green Party) are represented by party groups in the European Parliament. In the end, those will determine the decision-making process in the European Parliament. That’s why we decided to ask them to position themselves towards the EUROMAT theses and not directly our political parties at state level."

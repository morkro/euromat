  "content": "As a digital tool the EUROMAT's DNA consists of mainly Ones and Zeros. Yet, for the right composition it needs a dedicated team working on the statements, collecting the parties's positions and comments and finally working the technical magic. Since September 2018 a team of volunteers has been working on the development of the EUROMAT. We are members of Polis180 e.V., a grassroots think tank for Foreign and European Policy, and of Pulse of Europe e.V. We joined efforts to publish the EUROMAT together.",

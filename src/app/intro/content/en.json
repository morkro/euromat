      "answer": "The EUROMAT presents 33 statements on different European policy areas - such as migration or security - which you agree, disagree with or react neutrally to.

      "title": "How did we develop the EUROMAT?",
      "answer": "In a first step, our team developed 49 statements about european politics in several workshops. Our goals were:\n\n* to cover a maximum of relevant topics for European societies\n* to cover a broad range of diverse political opinions\n\nIn a second step, partners from other countries examined the statements for relevance in their respective countries and gave feedback. With this feedback we finalized the statements. Then we sent those statements to 21 parties of the European Parliament. They were asked to agree, disagree or remain neutral towards those statements. Additionally, they had the possibility to give a short explanation to their answer. \n\nThe answers of European parties were analyzed and 33 statements were selected to be included in the EUROMAT. The selection of the final statements was based on their capacity to help differentiate between the parties. The answers were then translated by our partners to spread the EUROMAT in the most countries possible."

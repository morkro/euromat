      "title": "What is the EUROMAT?",
      "answer": "The EUROMAT presents 33 statements on different European policy areas - such as migration or security - which you agree, disagree with or react neutrally to. Ultimately, your answers will be compared with the positions of the European parties, and the matching results presented as a percentage of correspondence. It is not a voting advice, it is just a indication based on the 33 statements selected. \n\nAfter finishing the EUROMAT, you are provided with an overview of the affiliations of the political parties in your Member State to the European ones."

      "title": "How did we develop the EUROMAT?",
      "answer": "In a first step, we developed statements in several workshops. Our goals were:\n\n* to cover a maximum of relevant topics for European societies\n* to cover a broad range of diverse political opinions\n\nIn a second step, partners from other countries examined the statements for relevance in their respective countries and gave us feedback. With this feedback we finalized the statements. \n\nThen we sent a total of 49 statements to 21 parties of the European Parliament. They were asked to agree, disagree or remain neutral towards those statements. Additionally, they had the possibility to give a short explanation to their answer. \n\nThe answers of European parties were analyzed and 33 were selected to be included in the EUROMAT. The selection of the final statements was based on their capacity to help differentiate between the parties."

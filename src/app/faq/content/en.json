      "title": "What is the EUROMAT?",
      "answer": "EUROMAT is an interactive tool that allows you to compare your positions on selected European policy issues with those of the German parties."
    },
    {
      "title": "How does the EUROMAT work?",
      "answer": "EUROMAT presents a total of 23 theses on various issues of European politics, which you can rate as \"agree\", \"disagree\" or \"neutral\". Your answers are then compared with the positions of the German parties and a ranking is created based on the percentage of agreement with the respective party. The EUROMAT calculation model is based on the calculation model of the Federal Agency for Civic Education, which is available under a free licence (Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 3.0)."

      "title": "How did we develop the EUROMAT?",
      "answer": "With a total of 23 theses, EUROMAT covers a broad thematic spectrum - from European economic and financial policy to asylum and climate policy to institutional reforms. The theses were formulated by the participating organisations and their members and address central issues of German European policy. Some of the theses submitted to the parties were not included in the final version of the EUROMAT - for example, because the answers of all parties were very similar.\n\n\nFor the EUROMAT, all German parties that won at least one seat in the European Parliament in the 2019 European elections were asked. Of them, CDU/CSU, SPD, Greens, FDP, Left Party, Free Voters, Volt, Pirates and Animal Protection Party responded and contributed their positions to the EUROMAT. In addition, the parties were able to justify their positions in short texts. Since the CDU/CSU and SPD had not evaluated all theses by the editorial deadline of 9 September 2021, their positions on some theses were supplemented in accordance with their election programmes. The corresponding theses are marked in the explanatory texts of the parties."
